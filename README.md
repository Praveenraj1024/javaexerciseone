1. Write a program which accepts a number as input and check whether the given number is
palindrome or not If it is a palindrome then
a. Add all the even numbers and check whether the sum is more than 25.
b. Print success and failure messages for all 3 conditions
Input : 2468642
Output : 2468642 is palindrome and the sum of even numbers is greater than 25
Input: 12345
Output: 12345 is not palindrome
Input: 12345654321
Output : 12345654321 is palindrome and sum of even numbers is less than 25


2. Write a program which accepts an integer number as input from the user and perform the
following conditional checks:
a. Print Tom if number is odd and exists between 20 to 30
b. Print Jerry, if number is even and exists between 20 and 30

3. Create a program that accepts a word as input and checks for each single character letter in
the word whether it is a consonant or vowel.
Condition:
a. Print an error message if the input is not a letter
b. If the input having more than one letter, print the required output
(Vowel or Consonant) for each letter
Input : p
Output : Consonant
Input : ap
Output : Vowel Consonant (should it be a - vowel, p - consonant)

4. Write a program using a loop to print the following output. 1 2 2 3 3 3 4 4 4 4 5 5 5 5 5 6 6 6 6
6 6 . . . nth iteration.
Input: 5
Output : 1 2 2 3 3 3 4 4 4 4 5 5 5 5 5
